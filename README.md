It has a clean and polished user interface.


## Description

This application is a password generator that creates a random password based on user's preferences. The user can choose the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and the type of characters to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters). The application then generates a random password based on the user's input and displays it on the page. When you click the "Generate Password" button, the application prompts you for the password criteria. When you answer each prompt, the application validates your input and makes sure that the password length is between 8 and 128 characters and that at least one character type is selected. If you answer each prompt correctly (click 'Ok' for yes or click 'Cancel' for no), the application generates a password that matches the selected criteria. The password is then written on the textarea provided in the mid-section of the page.
